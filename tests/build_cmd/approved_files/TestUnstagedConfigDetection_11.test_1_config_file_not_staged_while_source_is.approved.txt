Scenario: Build fails when config-src/ is staged but corresponding config/ output is not

Git staging state:
config-src/_shared/extra.md is staged
config/_shared/extra.md is NOT staged

stdout:
    unchanged: _shared/CLAUDE.md
    unchanged: _shared/extra.md
  briefcase-build: config/ files need to be staged:
    unstaged: config/_shared/extra.md

stderr:
(empty)

exit code:
1

Expected behavior:
exit code should be 1 so pre-commit blocks the commit
