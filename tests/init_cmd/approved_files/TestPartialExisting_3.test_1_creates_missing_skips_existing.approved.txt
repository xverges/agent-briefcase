Scenario: Init with partially existing structure creates missing parts, skips existing

Setup:
config-src/_includes/README.md already exists with custom content

stdout:
    created: config/
    created: config-src/_shared/
    created: BRIEFCASE.md
    skipped: config-src/_includes/README.md (already exists)
    created: dotfiles/README.md

stderr:
(empty)

exit code:
0

directory tree after init:
BRIEFCASE.md
config-src/_includes/README.md
dotfiles/README.md

config-src/_includes/README.md (preserved):
existing includes readme
