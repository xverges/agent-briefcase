Scenario: config-src/_includes/README.md explains the _includes directory

config-src/_includes/README.md:
# _includes

Place reusable fragments here. Reference them from any template with:

```
{{include filename.md}}
```

The directive must be on its own line. Fragments can include other fragments.
