Scenario: BRIEFCASE.md contains operational guide for the team

BRIEFCASE.md:
# Team Briefcase

This repo holds your team's shared AI agent configuration. It is managed by
[agent-briefcase](https://github.com/xverges/agent-briefcase).

## Directory structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `config-src/_shared/` | Configuration that syncs to **all** target repos. |
| `config-src/<project>/` | Configuration that syncs only to the matching repo. |
| `config-src/_includes/` | Reusable fragments referenced by `{{include <file>}}` directives. |
| `config/` | **Generated** — do not edit directly. Built from `config-src/` on every commit. |
| `dotfiles/` | A place to share personal dotfiles with the team. Not managed by briefcase. |

## Editing configuration

1. Edit files under `config-src/`.
2. Use `{{include <file>}}` to pull in fragments from `_includes/`.
3. Preview the result with `pre-commit run briefcase-build --all-files`.
4. Commit — the `briefcase-build` pre-commit hook assembles `config/` automatically.

## Adding the sync hook to a target repo

In the target repo's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
default_install_hook_types: [post-checkout, post-merge]
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/xverges/agent-briefcase
    rev: v0.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: briefcase-sync
        args: [--briefcase=../briefcase]
```

Then run `pre-commit install`.
