Scenario: Project-specific files override shared files at the same path

Briefcase contents:
_shared/CLAUDE.md      → '# shared version'
my-project/CLAUDE.md   → '# project-specific version'

stdout:
  briefcase: synced CLAUDE.md
  briefcase: updated .briefcase.lock (remember to commit it)

stderr:
(empty)

exit code:
0

CLAUDE.md in target (project wins):
# project-specific version
